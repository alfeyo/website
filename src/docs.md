## What's new on flutter.io

<b>Oct 31, 2018</b>

Welcome to the revamped Flutter website!

We've spent the last few months redesigning the website and how its
information is organized. We hope you can more easily find the docs
you are looking for. Some of the changes to the website include:

* New [landing](/) page
* New [showcase](/showcase) page
* New navigation in the left side bar
* New table of contents on the right side of most pages
* New 404 page (_not yet_)
* A [sitemap](/sitemap) (_not yet_)
* New custom search  (_not yet_)

Some of the new and updated content includes:

* New [cookbook](/cookbook) recipes
* A deep dive on Flutter internals called
  [Inside Flutter](/resources/inside-flutter)
* A new [technical videos](/resources/videos) page.
* A new page (not yet complete) on how to connect [a native debugger _and_
  a Dart debugger to your app](/testing/debugging/oem)
* A [placeholder page for the new background Dart processes
  feature](development/packages-and-plugins/background-processes)
  (recently introduced to Flutter), that links to an in-depth post
  on Medium. (This will be eventually replaced by actual documentation.)
* [PENDING]

If you have questions or comments about the new site, [file an
issue](https://github.com/flutter/website/issues).
